# C12 Employee Tracker

## Challenge 12 in MSU Bootcamp

Any business owner needs to keep track of the departments, roles, and employees in their company.  This is a command line application that allows the user to view and manage these things in order to organize and plan their business.  Developing this application introduced me to Mysql and sharpened my back end development skills.
